# Project Figment: Vision Tracking Subsystem

Early-stage software architecture for a custom interactive animatronic figure.

**Overview:** This repository contains the machine vision and facial tracking logic used to control the animatronic's eye movements. The system actively tracks a user's face via webcam and dynamically translates that spatial data into reactive, digital eye positioning.

**Current Features:**
* **Real-time Facial Tracking:** Maps user positioning to digital coordinates.
* **Dynamic Gaze:** Eyes smoothly follow the user across the field of view.
* **Proximity Reactions:** Programmed to squint when the tracked subject is far away and cross-eyes when the subject breaches minimum proximity.

**Status:** Active Development
